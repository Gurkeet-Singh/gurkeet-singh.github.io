                        <br>
                        <p>This Power BI dashboard visualizes COVID-19 data from around the world, providing insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic as well as the progress of vaccination efforts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Using data from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization and Our World in Data, I designed and developed the dashboard, which is divided into four sections focusing on overall COVID-19 data, cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The visualizations are easy to understand and accessible, making it a useful tool for individuals, healthcare professionals, and policymakers alike. With this dashboard, we can better understand the effects of COVID-19 and track the progress of vaccination efforts in real-time.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>I analyzed a dataset of customer demographics in order to identify patterns and insights into bike sales. By using Python and data visualization techniques, I found that middle-aged customers without children were the most likely to purchase a bike.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Based on these findings, I recommended targeted advertising and promotions to attract this demographic, as well as exploring financing options for those who may not have the full amount to purchase a bike outright.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, the project demonstrated the importance of using data analysis to inform business decisions and maximize profitability.

                            I conducted a profit analysis project to identify the key factors contributing to higher profits in a movie sales business. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, I analyzed a financial dataset related to movie sales to find that increasing revenue from popular movies is the main contributor to higher profits, while reducing marketing and advertising expenses can help increase profits.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I also discovered seasonality and higher profit margins in online sales channels. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and data analysis tools to inform strategic business decisions in the movie sales industry.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to higher profits in the movie industry and demonstrates my ability to use data analysis tools to inform business decisions.
